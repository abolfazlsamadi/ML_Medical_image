This project shows us how to use artificial intelligence and machine learning in medical scan analysis.

#Objectives in this plan:

In this project, we try to use artificial intelligence algorithms and machine vision of conventional scans in medicine such as MRI, CT Scan, XRay and ...

Is being studied and analyzed and the results are reported as a file in a database.

This project demonstrates the importance of using artificial intelligence in medical science and helping to diagnose medical scans faster and more accurately.



In the end, I thank all the people who guide and help me in this way, especially Iranians on Twitter
